# Q1. Stack Using Array

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. In this question, a stack is implemented using an array without using any built-in stack library.

## Operations

- **PUSH()** - Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **POP()** - Removes the top element from the stack.
- **PEEK()** - Displays the top element without removing it.
- **DISPLAY()** - Displays all elements of the stack.

## Overflow and Underflow

Stack Overflow occurs when we try to insert an element into a full stack.

Stack Underflow occurs when we try to remove an element from an empty stack.

## Complexity

- **PUSH:** O(1)
- **POP:** O(1)
- **PEEK:** O(1)
- **DISPLAY:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

# Q2. Circular Queue Using Array

A circular queue is a linear data structure in which the last position is connected back to the first. It follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

In this question, a circular queue is implemented using an array.

## Operations

- **ENQUEUE()** - Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- **DEQUEUE()** - Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- **FRONT()** - Displays the front element.
- **DISPLAY()** - Displays all elements of the queue.

## Full and Empty Queue

The queue is full when there is no available position for a new element.

The queue is empty when there are no elements in the queue.

## Circular Queue vs Linear Queue

A circular queue makes better use of available memory because the unused positions at the beginning can be reused.

In a linear queue, when the rear reaches the last position, unused spaces at the beginning may remain unavailable.

## Complexity

- **ENQUEUE:** O(1)
- **DEQUEUE:** O(1)
- **FRONT:** O(1)
- **DISPLAY:** O(n)
